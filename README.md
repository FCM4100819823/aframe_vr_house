4. Time machine: Pull the switch to turn back time, when there's no Covid. Back then, we can have friends come over for a small party. Besides, There are some other changes to the livingroom/working room as well. For example, the you car and the past only show up in the present meaning we have more alone time which made us to have a toy and a cat. The bookself changes its position too, from the working room to the living room, next to the TV.
